# Module 11.1 Module Project Assignment - FastAPI

1. Start from scratch: Create a new, empty project
2. Choose a classification problem.
3. Gather labeled data to train your model
   1. Feel free to use one of the datasets in scikit
   2. (Stretch Goal) Make your own dataset
4. Engineer your data as little as possible
5. Select a few scikit models that are well suited for the task
   1. RandomForestClassifier is always a good start
6. Train, test and tune your models
   1. Hyperparameter tuning: Grid or Random SearchCV
7. Serialize your best model with joblib
8. Integrate your serialized model into a simple FastAPI app
   1. Use Pydantic to define the input data to be used as a prediction basis with your model
   2. Add documentation to the endpoint doc string so visitors understand its motivation
9. Varify the quality of your app by making a few predictions on the swagger docs page of your app
   1. Fix any bugs you find, but remember the 20-minute rule!
