# Module 11.1 Module Project Assignment - FastAPI

In this module project, you'll be building a machine learning classifier from the ground up. You will select a classification problem, gather and prepare a labeled dataset with minimal engineering, and evaluate several scikit-learn models to determine the most effective for your task. After training and fine-tuning your chosen models, you will serialize the best performer and integrate it into a FastAPI application, using Pydantic for input data validation. Finally, you will test your model's predictions within your app's documentation page and optionally deploy your app using ngrok to share your work. This hands-on project is designed to reinforce your machine learning development skills by bringing a data science solution into a real-world application.


1. Start from scratch: Create a new, empty project
2. Choose a classification problem.
3. Gather labeled data to train your model
   1. Feel free to use one of the datasets in scikit
   2. (Stretch Goal) Make your own dataset
4. Engineer your data as little as possible
5. Select a few scikit models that are well suited for the task
   1. RandomForestClassifier is always a good start
6. Train, test and tune your models
   1. Hyperparameter tuning: Grid or Random SearchCV
7. Serialize your best model with joblib
8. Integrate your serialized model into a simple FastAPI app
   1. Add documentation to the endpoint doc string so visitors understand its motivation
9. Varify the quality of your app by making a few predictions on the swagger docs page of your app
   1. Fix any bugs you find, but remember the 20-minute rule!
10. (Stretch Goal) Use a free ngrok account to share your app with others
