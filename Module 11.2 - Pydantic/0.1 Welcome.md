# Unit 3, Sprint 11, Module 2: Paving the Way with Pydantic

Welcome to Module 2 of Sprint 11! Having covered FastAPI, we're now going to focus on a key library that plays a vital role in our Web API: Pydantic.

Pydantic is a data validation library that uses Python type annotations to validate that data matches the expected format. It's an essential tool in FastAPI applications, ensuring that incoming data adheres to the right structure and helping to generate automatic API documentation.
