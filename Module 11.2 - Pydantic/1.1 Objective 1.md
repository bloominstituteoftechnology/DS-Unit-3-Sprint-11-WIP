## Sprint 11, Module 2, Objective 1 - Pydantic Data Validation

### Overview

At its core, Pydantic is all about data validation. If a data structure does not match the expected structure, Pydantic raises an error detailing what was wrong with the provided data.

In this module, we'll dive deep into Pydantic, exploring its features and understanding how it enhances our FastAPI application.

### Creating Pydantic Models

Pydantic models are classes that inherit from the `BaseModel` class provided by Pydantic. They define the structure of your data using Python type annotations. Here's an example of a Pydantic model:

```python
from typing import Literal, TypeAlias
from pydantic import BaseModel

ModelId: TypeAlias = Literal[
    "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1",
    "SG161222/Realistic_Vision_V1.4",
    "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5",
]

class Job(BaseModel):
    job_id: str
    prompt: str
    model_id: ModelId
    height: int
    width: int
    guidance_scale: float
    num_inference_steps: int

```

This `Job` model defines the expected structure of a job in our FastAPI application. Each attribute of the model has a type annotation, indicating the type of data it should contain. Here's an example of a JSON payload that matches the Job model...

```json
{
  "job_id": "abc-987654321",
  "prompt": "Photograph of an astronaut riding a horse on Mars.",
  "model_id": "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1",
  "height": 512,
  "width": 768,
  "guidance_scale": 7.5,
  "num_inference_steps": 50
}
```

A TypeAlias is a feature introduced in Python 3.10 to explicitly create an alias for a type. In your code, ModelId is an alias for the type `Literal["stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1", "SG161222/Realistic_Vision_V1.4", "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5"]`. The alias just gives a more convenient name to the type and doesn't create a new type.

The Literal type hint, as used in the ModelId TypeAlias, restricts the value that a variable of this type can take to be one of the provided literals. In this case, a variable with type ModelId must be one of the three given string literals: "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1", "SG161222/Realistic_Vision_V1.4", or "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5".

When used in the context of a Pydantic model, this serves as a form of validation. When data is parsed into a Job model instance, if the value of model_id is not one of the specified strings, Pydantic will raise a ValidationError.

The combination of TypeAlias and Literal provides a convenient and readable way to ensure that specific values are used for certain fields in your Pydantic models. This is a powerful tool for data validation.

### Using Pydantic Models in FastAPI

In FastAPI, we use Pydantic models to define the expected structure of the data in HTTP requests and responses. Here's how we can modify the `/jobs` endpoint to use our `Job` model:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class SimpleJob(BaseModel):
    job_id: str

@app.post("/jobs")
async def create_job(job: SimpleJob):
    return {"job_id": job.job_id}

```

In this example, the `create_job` function expects a `Job` instance as an argument. FastAPI automatically validates the request data against the `Job` model, ensuring that the data matches the expected structure before the function is called. If the data does not match the structure, FastAPI sends a helpful error response detailing what was wrong.

### Automatic API Documentation

One of the advantages of using Pydantic models in FastAPI is that they contribute to the automatic generation of API documentation. FastAPI uses the structure defined by the Pydantic models to generate interactive API documentation that allows users to explore the API and send properly formatted requests.

In the next module, we will dive into more advanced FastAPI topics, further enhancing our app's functionality with a stable diffusion model. Stay tuned!


### Challenge
1. Replace SimpleJob with Job, this is the validation model we'll use in later modules.
2. Send compatible and incompatible data to your API and see what happens.
3. What if we wanted to control how many characters the `job_id` was allowed to have?
4. What if we wanted to control the range of the `guidance_scale`?
