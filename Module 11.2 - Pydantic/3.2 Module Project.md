# Module 11.2 Module Project Assignment - Pydantic

1. Start from scratch: Create a new, empty project.
2. Choose a problem domain: It could be image classification, sentiment analysis, or any other problem that requires structured input data. 
3. Train, test and tune your ML model.
4. Design your Pydantic model: Base it on the structure of the data you're model needs to make predictions.
   1. Use Python type annotations to define the expected structure of the data.
5. Integrate Pydantic model into your FastAPI application:
   1. Start with a simple endpoint like `POST /predict`.
   2. Ensure that FastAPI validates request data against your Pydantic model.
6. Test your endpoints: You can do this manually or by writing automated tests.
   1. Try sending both valid and invalid data to see how your application responds.
7. Generate and review automatic API documentation: FastAPI uses the structure defined by your Pydantic models to do this.
   1. Check if the documentation correctly represents the structure of your data.
8. Refine your models and endpoints based on tests and documentation review:
   1. Add additional validation if needed.
   2. Fix any bugs you find, but remember the 20-minute rule!
9. (Stretch Goal) Extend your application: You could add more endpoints, integrate with a database, or even include some machine learning models.
