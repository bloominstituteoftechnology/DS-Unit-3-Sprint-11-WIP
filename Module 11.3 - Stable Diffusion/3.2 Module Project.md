# Module 11.3 Module Project Assignment - Stable Diffusion API using FastAPI

1. Initialize your project: Start with a fresh, empty project for your FastAPI application.
2. For this project, you will be using Stable Diffusion for text-to-image generation. The task is to create an API that takes a textual description as input and generates an image. Choose a different model than the ones we used in class.
3. Design your Pydantic model: Create a Pydantic model that defines the structure of the data your model needs to generate an image. This should include Python type annotations to define the expected structure of the text input.
    1. For instance, your model might include a string field for the text description.
4. Integrate Pydantic model into your FastAPI application:
    1. Define a new FastAPI route like `POST /text-to-image` that uses your Pydantic model to validate request data.
    2. Implement your Stable Diffusion model within this route to generate an image based on the validated input text.
5. Test your endpoints: Write tests to verify your API endpoint.
    1. Make sure to test both valid and invalid data inputs to ensure your application responds appropriately.
    2. Verify that the generated image corresponds accurately to the input text.
6. Generate and review automatic API documentation: FastAPI uses the structure defined by your Pydantic models to automatically generate API documentation.
    1. Check if the documentation correctly represents the structure of your data and the functionality of your API.
7. Refine your models and endpoints:
    1. Add additional validation to your Pydantic models if necessary.
    2. Debug any issues you find, but remember the 20-minute rule - if you're stuck on a problem for more than 20 minutes, seek help or try a different approach!
8. (Stretch Goal) Extend your application: Some possible extensions could include:
    1. Adding more endpoints, such as one for retraining the model with new data.
    2. Implementing additional models or techniques for image generation.

Remember, the goal of this assignment is not just to produce a functioning API, but to practice using FastAPI and Pydantic in a real-world application scenario. Good luck!
