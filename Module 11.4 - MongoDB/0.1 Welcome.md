# Module 11.4: MongoDB for Robust Data Handling

Welcome to Module 4 of Sprint 11! In the previous modules, we've learned about FastAPI and the Stable Diffusion process for image generation. Now, we're going to introduce a new component to our tech stack: MongoDB. MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program, classified as a NoSQL database program.

In this module, we'll first explore MongoDB and its Python driver, PyMongo. Then, we will integrate MongoDB into our FastAPI application to store and retrieve information about the Stable Diffusion jobs.
