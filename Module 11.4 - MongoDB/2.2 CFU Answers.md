### Multiple Choice Questions

1. **c) NoSQL Database Program** - MongoDB is classified as a NoSQL database program, which means it does not use a tabular relational database structure.

2. **c) Python** - PyMongo is specifically designed as a Python driver for MongoDB, allowing Python programs to interact with MongoDB databases.

3. **d) `pip install python-dotenv fastapi pymongo`** - This command installs PyMongo along with other necessary dependencies for the project.

4. **c) JSON-like documents** - MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, allowing for varied fields and adaptable data structures.

5. **c) Database Password** - In the connection string, `<password>` should be replaced with the database password that was created during the setup process.

6. **b) Loading environment variables from the `.env` file** - The `load_dotenv()` function is used to load environment variables from the `.env` file, including the MongoDB URL.

7. **c) `insert_one()`** - This method is part of the PyMongo library and is used to insert a single document into a MongoDB collection.

8. **a) AWS, Google, and Azure** - These are the hosting providers that can be chosen when setting up a MongoDB project.

9. **d) `MongoClient`** - The `MongoClient` class in `pymongo` is responsible for operations like insert, find, update, and delete on the database.

10. **b) To authenticate the API requests** - The `SECRET_TOKEN` is used to authenticate API requests, ensuring that only authorized users can access the API endpoints.

11. **False** - MongoDB is not a relational database; it is a document-oriented NoSQL database.

12. **True** - PyMongo is the Python driver for MongoDB, enabling interaction with MongoDB databases within Python programs.

13. **False** - During the MongoDB setup, your current IP address is automatically added, not removed.

14. **False** - The `M0` tier database in MongoDB setup is a free option, not a paid one.

15. **True** - MongoDB allows for flexibility in data structure, so you can change the data structure over time.

16. **False** - The `find_one()` method in PyMongo returns only one document that matches the given query, not all matching documents.

17. **True** - The `requirements.txt` file includes dependencies necessary for the project, including FastAPI, PyMongo, and python-dotenv.

18. **False** - The `api_key_header_auth` variable in `auth.py` is used to authenticate API requests, not the database connection.

19. **True** - The `create_record` function is part of the database interface and is responsible for creating a new record in the database.

20. **True** - The `UpdateRecord` class in the `data.py` file defines a model with optional fields, allowing for partial updates to a record in the database.
