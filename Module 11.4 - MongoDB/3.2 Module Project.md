# Module 11.4 Module Project Assignment - MongoDB for Robust Data Handling

This project will allow you to apply the knowledge gained in this module to create a robust data handling system using MongoDB and FastAPI. By implementing CRUD operations, adding authentication, and deploying your application, you'll gain practical experience with modern web development practices.

1. **Start from scratch: Create a new, empty project**
2. **Choose a data domain for storage (e.g., user profiles, product inventory, etc.)**
3. **Set up MongoDB for your project**
    1. Sign up for a free MongoDB account (if you haven't already)
    2. Create a new project and a free-tier `M0` database
    3. Choose a hosting provider and region close to you
    4. Create a username and password for your database
    5. Save your connection string to a `.env` file
4. **Integrate MongoDB into a FastAPI application**
    1. Install necessary dependencies like PyMongo, FastAPI, and python-dotenv
    2. Create a database interface to interact with your MongoDB instance
    3. Design data models for your chosen domain using Pydantic
5. **Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations**
    1. Create endpoints for inserting, retrieving, updating, and deleting records in MongoDB
6. **Secure your API with authentication**
    1. Implement an API key-based authentication mechanism
    2. Use FastAPI's security utilities to protect your endpoints
7. **Test your application**
    1. Verify the functionality of your CRUD operations
    2. Ensure proper authentication and error handling
    3. (Stretch Goal) Write automated tests using FastAPI's testing utilities
8. **Document your API**
    1. Use FastAPI's built-in documentation tools (Swagger UI) to provide clear documentation for your endpoints via docstrings
    2. Include examples and explanations for users to understand the purpose and usage of each endpoint
9. **Deploy your application or host it locally (Stretch Goal)**
    1. Consider deploying your FastAPI application to a cloud platform
    2. Or use a service like ngrok to share your local app with others
10. **Reflect on the Project**
    1. Document the challenges and successes you experienced during this project
    2. Consider how MongoDB's flexibility and document-oriented nature influenced your design choices
    3. Explore potential improvements or additional features for your application
